# ML/DL Paradigms & Algorithms

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of first-principles implementations of the major paradigms and algorithms **I've learned** within the field of machine learning, representation learning, and deep learning.

It's primary objective is to bookmark my progress as I study the seminal text, [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
