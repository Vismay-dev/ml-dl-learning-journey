## ML/DL Paradigms & Algorithms

**Note:** This repository has been publicly archived

**Why has this repository been archived?**
This record of projects is no longer actively maintained as I am currently focusing my efforts on other areas of machine learning research (non-linear programming). While the code remains available for reference, no further additions are planned for the foreseeable future.

### Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of first-principle implementations of major paradigms and algorithms **I've learned** within the field of machine learning, representation learning, and deep learning.

Its primary objective is to bookmark my progress as I study the seminal text, [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

### Progress
